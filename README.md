# ForgeMapFixer
Tag indices changed in ElDewrito 0.5.0.1, causing Forge maps built on the new maps in 0.5.0.0 to crash the game. This is a simple tool which repairs maps to work on 0.5.0.1 and above.

## Usage

1. Copy ForgeMapFixer.exe to the same folder as your ElDewrito 0.5.0.1 install.
2. Install any Forge maps as you normally would, by copying them into your mods/maps directory.
3. Run ForgeMapFixer.exe and wait for it to finish.
4. Run the game and play your maps.
